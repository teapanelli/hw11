# Paint the Town

A MS Paint-inspired drawing program made in p5.

## Summary

I grew up drawing on MS Paint as a kid, and I wanted to do something simple and artistic for my final project. It won't be flashy orexcessive, just barebones and simple to call back to its reference material.

Interactivity will include keyboard and mouse input. I might add some cute background music or something, but for now there won't be any additional music for pressing keys or drawing (though there could be!). 

## Component Parts

The Project is just a p5 project, so there is nothing particularly outstanding about the code I'm using. 
**edit: additional code might be borrowed from outside sources, though I'm not sure where they would be implemented yet.
