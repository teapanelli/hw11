# Point-and-Click

Image that will change and make noise/etc. depending on what you click/drag/etc.

## Summary

I want to make an image that the player can click and drag and interact with. It won't be a Sierra-Game type of thing, no dialogue or stuff like that, but there is that kind of compressed, 8-bit audio and image quality, and quirkiness I want to work with.

Interactivity would include sound, key commands, and mouse commands.
